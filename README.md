- **Continued Conversations**: Use `lexido -c [prompt]` to continue a previous conversation, allowing for context-aware suggestions.
- **Piping Support**: Pipe commands into Lexido (e.g., `ls | lexido [prompt]`) for enhanced command list suggestions.
- **Efficiency**: Designed with efficiency in mind, Lexido helps you get things done NOW.

## Installation

### For Arch Linux:
Lexido is available on the AUR. Install it using the package manager of your choice such as:
```bash
yay -S lexido
```
### For others and macOS:
Head to the [releases](https://github.com/micr0-dev/lexido/releases) tab to pick up a binary!
Once downloaded, you'll want to make Lexido easily accessible from anywhere on your computer. Here's how:

1. **Rename the downloaded file:**

   The downloaded file might have a long and specific name, like "v1.0-lexido-linux-amd64". For easier use, consider renaming it to just "lexido". 

2. **Make the file executable:**

   Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the Lexido binary. Then, run the following command to make the file executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x ./lexido
   ```

3. **Move the file to your system's path:**

   **Why do this?** By placing the renamed and executable Lexido file in your system's path, you can run it from any terminal window without needing to specify the full path to the file. It's a shortcut for convenience!

   Here's an example command assuming you downloaded Lexido to your Downloads folder:

   ```bash
   mv ~/Downloads/lexido /usr/local/bin/lexido
   ```

### Compile from source
Ensure you have Go installed on your system. Follow these steps to install Lexido:

1. Clone the Lexido repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/micr0-dev/lexido.git
```

2. Navigate to the Lexido directory:
```bash
cd lexido
```

3. Build the project:
```bash
go build
```

4. Optionally, move the Lexido binary to a location in your PATH for easy access.

## Running locally
If you want to run lexido completely locally you can do that as of version 1.3! This is done via [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama), a tool for easily running large language models locally. It does all the hard work of installing LLMs for you!

You can install [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) as follows:

### Linux:
```
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

### macOS:
[Download](https://ollama.com/download/Ollama-darwin.zip)

After you have installed Ollama running lexido locally is as easy as adding the `-l` flag when you want to run locally, or using `--setLocal` to run locally by default! You can also select the model you want to run with `-m` and again set it to be the default with `--setModel`. Be sure you have the model installed before attempting to run it with lexido however! 
## Usage
- To get command suggestions:
```bash
lexido "install teamspeak via docker"
```

- To continue with a previous prompt:
```bash
lexido -c "add more details or follow-up"
```

- To use with piping commands:
```bash
ls | lexido "what should I do with these files?"
```

## FAQ

### Why is the binary so big?
The binary's size mainly consists of the built-in networking and encryption libraries of Go. 
A quick inspection showcases this:
```bash
> goweight
   12 MB runtime
  8.1 MB net/http
  5.3 MB google.golang.org/protobuf/internal/impl
  4.1 MB net
  4.1 MB golang.org/x/net/http2
  3.9 MB golang.org/x/sys/unix
  3.7 MB crypto/tls
  3.3 MB google.golang.org/grpc
```
### How does it know what system I am running?
Before requesting the LLM the program does what is known as prompt building or contextualization, it collects different data about your system and your current scenario to help the LLM more accurately answer. Giving the LLM context about your situation allows it to better understand what you are asking or how to reply.
